# About
Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University. I am advised by Professor Finale Doshi-Velez of the [Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK)](https://dtak.github.io/) Lab. My research focuses on reinforcement learning, foundation models, and AI/machine learning models for decision-making under uncertainty.
